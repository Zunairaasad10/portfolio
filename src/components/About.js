            <p>Hi! My name is Zunaira Asad, and I am a passionate web developer and designer. I enjoy creating clean, modern, and user-friendly websites that bring ideas to life. <br/>

Currently, I am learning React to build powerful and dynamic web applications. Along the way, I am also exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend development to strengthen my skills. <br/>

I believe in continuous learning and love experimenting with new tools and technologies. My goal is to combine creativity and functionality to design digital experiences that make an impact.</p>
